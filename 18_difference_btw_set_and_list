Explain the difference between a set and a list in Python.

Set:

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored.
Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after creating them.
Sets do not support indexing or slicing because they are unordered.
Sets are typically used when you need to perform operations like checking for membership, finding intersections, unions, differences, etc.
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


List:

A list is an ordered collection of elements.
Lists are defined using square brackets [] or the list() constructor.
Lists can contain duplicate elements, and they maintain the order of insertion.
Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify, add, or remove elements after creating them.
Lists support indexing and slicing, allowing you to access individual elements or sublists.
Lists are versatile and commonly used for tasks like storing collections of items, iterating over elements, sorting, etc.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
