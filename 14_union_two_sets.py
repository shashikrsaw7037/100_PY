# How do you find the union of two sets in Python?
set1 = {3,4,5}
set2 = {7,8,9,5}
union_set =set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)

# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Find the union of the two sets using the | operator
union_set = set1 | set2

# Print the union set
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
